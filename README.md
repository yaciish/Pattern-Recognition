# Pattern-Recognition

Learning folder:
- Part 1:
    * Generate Gaussian random vectors using uniform random variables.
    * Diagonalize the distributions
    * Generating 200 points of each distribution before diagonalization and plotting them
    * Generating 200 points of each distribution after diagonalization and plotting them

- Part 2:
    * Generate 200 points of each distribution before diagonalization and plot them.
    * Compute the optimal Bayes discriminant function for the points
    * Generate 200 new points for each class for testing.
    * plot training points after diagonalization
    * compute the optimal Bayes discriminant function for the testing points
 
- Part 3:
    * Generate 200 training points before diagonalization and plot.
    * estimate the parameters of each distribution using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methodology.
    * estimate each univariate distribution using a Parzen Window approach.
    * compute the optimal Bayes discriminant function for ML, Bayes, and Parzen schemes.
    * Generate 200 new points for each class for testing using a ten-fold cross validation.
